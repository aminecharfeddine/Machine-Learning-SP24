Well, as far as learning Pandas could be considered a break, anyway. We will learn more of this library over the following weeks, I hope you will develop an appreciation for its use over time.  \n",

    "It is time to introduce some of the math applications of Pandas DataFrame and Series, and to the unfriendly-but-oh-so-useful `groupby()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on we will be using Pandas containers for our data, even directly for the math calculation. Remember that they wrap around Numpy arrays (and you know how to use those now) while giving convenient indexing and extra capabilities. No need to e.g. split the points based on their class into a `dict` as we did for LDA: we can simply _group_ data by label, then all operations will work on the whole feature arrays, and run for all classes at once (and using the underlying, faster C implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Main hint: simply treat a DataFrame just like you would a multi-dimensional Numpy array. Just think of it as a matrix, as you already had, generalized to higher dimensions: a **tensor**. A Pandas Series on the other hand is just a one-dimensional Numpy array (vector). In either case, function calls will be _broadcasted_ to its elements: this means that they will run independently on each element and their results will be aggregated back in a data structure of the same type (list, Series or DataFrame).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `groupby()` extensively from today: typically it takes a while to grasp first, but your code will be legible, and you will need (almost) no more `for` loops nor `dict`s.  \n",
    "Careful though because the method returns a special [`GroupBy` object](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/groupby.html), that is somehow unwieldy: **it removes a feature, adds a dimension (the grouping), and does not print directly from its output**. Read this last sentence a couple of times, then again _after_ you start playing around with `groupby()` (seriously, write it on a post-it or something), and it will help to slowly make sense of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, try to follow each call to `groupby()` with a `describe()`, to really see what is happening. Also `print` the `groups` for an intuition on how the grouping works: it's basically a `dict` from each element of the \"group\" (e.g. the classes) to the `Index` values of the corresponding rows. With LDA we already did something similar, by hand, with a `dict` hashing the classes to the actual data (less efficient than using indices).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A `GroupBy` object is just an implicit (because performance) description on how to split/group the data: any operation you call on it will return multiple results, _one per group_, instead of just one value. This is a sort of \"automated mapping\", aka [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html). Go ahead and play with it a bit: understanding this point is necessary to solve the next questions.  \n",
    "The trick that did it for me, was to try and ignore its output *per se* (I don't even print it), imagine it's just a fancy version of LDA's per-class `dict` we built by hand, and just call functions on the output since _their_ output makes sense again for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, it is important that you need to start thinking of the dataset as a whole, single, high-dimensional entity, not just a list of points. It's a forest, not trees. Explore it by selecting and slicing this object from different perspectives, as if you were \"floating around it in space\" rather than being stuck to \"read one row at a time\". When you use a DataFrame for math, just remember that you are manipulating multiple variables at the same time, and you will get vectorial answers: treat it like a special Numpy data structure, and everything should eventually become intuitive."

    "- This is the first core ML method we are covering in the course. As you see you need to know quite a few concepts before we can really discuss its inner workings.\n",
    "- On the other hand, you now already own most of the glossary and knowledge needed, so you only need to put it all together. The rest of the course will follow this same pattern.\n",
    "- This is also your first method capable of *nonlinear classification*. Notice how LDA used nonlinear models for the data (Gaussian clusters) but still relied on linear separation boundaries (weirdly obtaining $m$ and $q$ from class-pair inequalities)? NB can work with multiple classes and different types of distributions (think Mixture of Gaussians), the division boundary is not (necessarily) a line anymore.\n",
    "- In the next two lectures we will start learning about one of the bigger classic ML tools still state-of-the-art today: the Support Vector Machine, and the Kernel Trick. We are reaching the \"cruise speed\" level of complexity for the course, we will stay close to this level until the exam. Keep up with the lectures and exercises and you should have no trouble. Good luck!"
