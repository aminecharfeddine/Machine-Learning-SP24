# 📚 Machine Learning – Assignments

This repository contains my assignments completed as part of the **Machine Learning** course in my Master's program in Data Analytics at the University of Fribourg.

The assignments cover a wide range of key machine learning topics, including:

- **Linear and polynomial regression**
- **Supervised classification** (k-NN, SVM, decision trees, random forests, etc.)
- **Dimensionality reduction** (PCA, t-SNE)
- **Unsupervised clustering** (k-means, DBSCAN)
- **Ensemble methods**
- **Model evaluation and cross-validation**
- **Basic neural networks**
- **Implementations using scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc.**

These assignments were completed in a strict academic setting under the supervision of several university instructors, including:

> Christophe Broillet, Giuseppe Cuccu, Philippe Cudré-Mauroux, Mattias Dürrmeier, Anna Fischer, Bastian Alexander Grossenbacher, Marcus Haag, Samy Rima, Simon Ruffieux.

🔒 **Note:** All notebooks were developed based on the official instructions provided by the course instructors. These are **not copies of external solutions**, but original work based on academic course material.
